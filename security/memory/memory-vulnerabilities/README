# Memory Vulnerability Assessment Benchmark Suite

* This test suite includes programs to identify and simulate various memory safety issues.

## Usage
### Running Testsuite
The testsuite can be run using
```bash
make r_all
```

This will compile and run all tests, and report the results in command line.  
The complete log will be available in the run directory as `run.log`. Logs for individual runs can be found in the `logs` directory.  

To compile all tests without running, use 
```bash
make c_all
```

### Running Tests Individually
To run a single test, use 
```bash
make r_<testname>
```
Example: `make r_oob_read`
